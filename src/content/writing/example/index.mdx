# Welcome to MDX in Astro!

This is an example of how you can use **MDX** to create rich, interactive content in your Astro site.

<CalloutBox type="info" title="What is MDX?">
  MDX is a format that lets you write JSX in your markdown content. You can import components, like interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.
</CalloutBox>

## Using Components in Markdown

One of the biggest advantages of MDX is the ability to use components directly in your markdown content.

Here's an example of using the LightningIcon component:

<div className="flex items-center gap-2 p-4 bg-button-light dark:bg-dark-primary rounded-lg">
  <LightningIcon />
  <p className="font-bold">Power up your content with components!</p>
</div>

## Interactive Components

You can even include interactive React components:

<ShuffleText />
<p>This would be an interactive component that shuffles text on hover.</p>

## Embedding Videos

With the YouTubeEmbed component, you can easily embed videos in your content:

<YouTubeEmbed 
  id="szrsfeyLzyg" 
  title="Demo of the Daily Log shortcut in action" 
/>

<CalloutBox type="warning">
  Make sure to use the video ID from the YouTube URL, not the full URL itself.
</CalloutBox>

## Regular Markdown Still Works

All the standard markdown features still work as expected:

- Lists
- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- [Links](https://automatethesuck.com)
- > Blockquotes
- `inline code`

```js
// Code blocks with syntax highlighting
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, MDX!");
}
```

## Images

You can use standard markdown images, which will inherit the styling from the prose classes:

{/* ![A beautiful landscape](./landscape.jpg) */}

Or you can use HTML/JSX for more control:

{/* <Image 
  src={customImage} 
  alt="Custom styled image" 
  className="rounded-full w-48 h-48 mx-auto my-8 shadow-lg"
/> */}

<CalloutBox type="success" title="Accessibility Tip">
  Always include descriptive alt text for your images to ensure they're accessible to everyone, including those using screen readers.
</CalloutBox>

## Conclusion

MDX gives you the best of both worlds - the simplicity of markdown with the power of components. Enjoy creating rich, interactive content for your readers!
