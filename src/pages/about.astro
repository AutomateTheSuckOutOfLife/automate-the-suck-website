      <p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-serif font-bold text-accent dark:text-dark-text mb-6">Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        We founded Automate the Suck Out of Life after recognizing a common problem: despite having powerful technology at our fingertips, many people struggle to use it effectively to improve their lives. We saw friends and family members overwhelmed by digital tools that were supposed to make life easier but often created more stress instead.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Drawing on Kaitlin's background in education and UX design, and Dylan's expertise in software engineering and accessibility, we set out to create resources that would help people harness technology on their own terms. We believe that technology should adapt to people's needs—not the other way around.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Today, we're building a community of like-minded individuals who share our vision of technology as a force for empowerment. Through our projects, workshops, and educational resources, we're working to create a world where everyone can use technology to enhance their lives, regardless of their technical background or resources.
      </p>
