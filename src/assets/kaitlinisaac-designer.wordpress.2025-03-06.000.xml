<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What even is Shortcuts?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Think of Shortcuts as a way to write mini custom apps for your iPhone. Whether automating daily tasks or creating something entirely new, Shortcuts gives you the power to make your phone truly work for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I've always been vaguely aware of the "Shortcuts" app on my phone and have had some simple premade ones that I never did much with (like "How many days until _____"), but I only recently really started using them. I was always intimidated by the workflow, and when I tried to make them previously, they often did not work out the way I had hoped for them to and I would get frustrated and give up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>So, what changed?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:embed {"url":"https://i.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExank3azRtODU3ajJ6aXZ2bW8waHFobHhobnU1ZTEwbnRrcTRuYmJ6eCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/qAtZM2gvjWhPjmclZE/giphy.gif","type":"rich","providerNameSlug":"embed-handler"} -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>ChatGPT, dude.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ChatGPT truly is what changed the game for me. Prior to ChatGPT, if I wanted to create my own shortcut from scratch, I had to really try to understand how all of the functions worked and what was even really possible. Luckily, I am married to a wonderful human who is as much as an Apple nerd as I am, but with more technical knowledge; so a lot of the times, I would tell him my idea and he could show me how to do it (or make it for me).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once I learned that ChatGPT was even better at creating and troubleshooting Shortcuts than my partner is, I was so much more confident to try creating some of my own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I find that I use Shortcuts as a new solution to problems that I have solved using different media previously. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, I found myself encountering situations where in the past, I would make a chart or flashcards or a journal to keep myself organized and complete the task at hand (I think of these as my <em>analog solutions</em>), but I also would find that I am not as effective at keeping up with my physical media these days. This lead me to think "okay, but what if I could just tap a button and my phone does it." When I used to have that thought, my solution was usually "There's probably an app for that."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So, why not just download another app?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These days I have found one or a combination of these problems with apps on my phone:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Doesn't have the features I want</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Does have the features I want, but also a million other things I don't want which makes it too complicated and bad</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Forces me to sign up for a membership, giving away my personal information</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Is a paid subscription</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Is "free" but has terrible ads everywhere</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Is tracking in the background without my knowledge</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Is being a general creep (<em>why</em> do you need access to every photo I've taken since I started using an iPhone??)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, what's the alternative to download a single-purpose app? Creating a Shortcut!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm going to dive into some problems that I solved with Shortcuts and my process of creating them. I hope that you can find some inspiration and create your own Shortcuts as well!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Shortcut #1: What's my workout today?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Context</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am a runner and I am training for the <a href="https://buffalomarathon.org/half-marathon">Buffalo Half-Marathon</a> this upcoming May 2025. I have mapped out my entire training schedule from now until the race (using ChatGPT as well), and had this beautiful spreadsheet of my whole training plan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Problem</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted to know what my workout was each day without having to reference to spreadsheet or my calendar. I wanted to tap a button and it would spit out what my workout is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">My Analog Solution</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My "analog solution" would have been to print out my spreadsheet, reference it each day and cross off the workout as I complete it. I maybe would have tried to keep a journal or keep this log in my bullet journal, but likely would have stopped using it by March.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Solution: Creating the Shortcut</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To start creating my Shortcut, I first went to ChatGPT and wrote the following prompt:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>I want to create an Apple Shortcut that will help me stay on track with my half-marathon training plan. I have the entirety of my plan in an Apple note. When I run the shortcut, I would like it to send me a message with what workout I have scheduled for that day. For example, if I ran the shortcut on January 7th, I would like the message to say “4x400m intervals (1:1 work:rest ratio). 
Can you help me create this shortcut?</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When writing this prompt, I really visualized what exactly I wanted my phone to do. Did I want it to send me a text or a notification? How would the Shortcut be able to see my training plan? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After sending this prompt, ChatGPT gave me step-by-step instructions on how to accomplish my goal. Here's an abbreviated version of what it told me to do:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Organize Your Apple Note</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Create a Shortcut in the Shortcuts App</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Add Actions to Your Shortcut</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Step 4: Save and Test Your Shortcut</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- /wp:jetpack/slideshow -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I immediately went to work following the instructions, very much in a similar manner to how I would follow instructions when operating a new machine or assembling furniture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I started by opening a new chat in ChatGPT and having it reformat my training plan in the way that it requested. I was able to upload the spreadsheet (.CSV) of my plan and ask ChatGPT to reformat it so that I could copy and paste the list into an Apple Note.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":171,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then I opened up the Shortcuts app and got to work following the next steps!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":173,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As with all things, it definitely was not perfect on the first try...Or the second try...Or the third... But I repeated this process of showing ChatGPT my work, ChatGPT telling me what I think I did wrong, and then reworking and retesting my Shortcut until I got my final result!</p>

<p>While writing this post, I continued to tinker with this Shortcut to make it even more customized to my needs. I added functionality to see tomorrow's workout (because I found myself wanting to more easily look ahead), and added functionality to view the weather forecast for my location. I still need to format the weather data to be useful, but it mostly works!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for Troubleshooting Shortcuts </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:details -->
<details class="wp-block-details"><summary>Don't give up</summary><!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Type / to add a hidden block"} -->
<p>This one may seem silly, but honestly not giving up is 80% of programming in my experience. I'm really brought back to my Algebra days, where I would try to solve an equation and miss one thing somewhere and my whole answer was hundreds of numbers off. I look to my wonderful teachers and embrace their attitude of starting with patience, then going back and looking at my work to diagnose where the problem is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></details>
<!-- /wp:details -->

<!-- wp:details -->
<details class="wp-block-details"><summary>Use the "Quick Look" or "Show Result" function under different steps of your Shortcut</summary><!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Type / to add a hidden block"} -->
<p>The "Quick Look" and "Show Result" allow you to see the result directly above of where you place this function. This allows you to check what your shortcut is outputting before you get the big result at the end</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></details>
<!-- /wp:details -->

<!-- wp:details -->
<details class="wp-block-details"><summary>Don't be afraid to start a new chat</summary><!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Type / to add a hidden block"} -->
<p>Sometimes ChatGPT can get really confused if you've been chatting for a long time or if you've asked it to do too many things in one chat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Type / to add a hidden block"} -->
<p>For example, ChatGPT initially tried to get me to use the "Dictionary" function in this shortcut instead of pulling my data from my existing note. When I started a new chat, I explicitly told that bot I did not want to use the Dictionary function.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I found it helpful to take the information about what I wasn't liking in one ChatGPT chat, and then start a new chat and prompt ChatGPT to not do the thing I didn't like it doing in the other chat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></details>
<!-- /wp:details -->

<!-- wp:details -->
<details class="wp-block-details"><summary>Take Screenshots and send them to ChatGPT</summary><!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Type / to add a hidden block"} -->
<p>I take screenshots of my shortcuts flow as well as any error messages. Be sure to still provide context and be specific about what problem you're having!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></details>
<!-- /wp:details -->

<!-- wp:details -->
<details class="wp-block-details"><summary>If you have a Mac, try creating the shortcut on your Mac instead of mobile.</summary><!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Type / to add a hidden block"} -->
<p>I have found that editing shortcuts tends to be easier on my Macbook, so sometimes switching up your device can make it easier! Shortcuts will sync across your devices, so you can still use the shortcut you create on your iPhone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></details>
<!-- /wp:details -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">More Uses for Shortcuts</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I've had a few other scenarios recently that inspired me to create a couple of other shortcuts!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although the shortcuts are different and are replacing different types of physical media in my life, the process of creating them is very much the same: See the problem, identify a solution, then work with ChatGPT to make it happen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I've found uses for shortcuts in my personal and professional life. Here are some other problems I solved using Shortcuts:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Shortcut #2: Pomodoro Break </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Context</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am a big fan of the Pomodoro Method (a time management method that breaks work into intervals: 25 minutes of work, 5 minutes of break, and 15 minutes of a long break after completing a certain number of work intervals). This is how I work most productively during my day!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Problem</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was having trouble deciding what to do during my breaks. I found that it was hard for me to make a quick decision on what I could accomplish in five minutes, so I often ended up scrolling on my phone, which did not usually help me feel recharged. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">My Analog Solution</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My analog solution likely would have been to write down ideas on paper and draw them out of a cup, but honestly, I probably wouldn't have gotten to that and would have continued to have less fulfilling breaks during my workflow. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">My Solution</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I ended up creating a shortcut that would choose a random activity from a list and setting a timer for the time of my break. This made it so that I didn't have to choose what to do, my phone simply told me what to do!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:media-text {"mediaId":189,"mediaType":"image","mediaWidth":40} -->
<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:40% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img src="https://kaitlinmisaac.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/cleanshot-2025-01-08-at-16.54.03.gif?w=404" alt="" class="wp-image-189 size-full" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"><!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Content…"} -->
<p>I decided to also add a "reshuffle" option, so that I could choose a different task if the first one wasn't what I wanted it to be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Content…"} -->
<p>The timer was also a later addition; I use the Pomodoro extension for Raycast, so my timers are automatically going on my Macbook, but I found that if I was out dusting the house on a break, I often lost track of time. Setting a timer on my phone was a much more practical way of holding myself accountable during the break time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div></div>
<!-- /wp:media-text -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This shortcut has been helping me work so much more productively. Taking breaks to move my body really does help my overall productivity! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Shortcut #3: Major Scales Practice </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Context</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I teach flute lessons to a high school freshman and she is currently working on memorizing all of her scales to prepare for her All-County Band audition. I prefer to choose a random set of scales rather than going in a pattern to keep her on her toes. I also wanted to log her performance on each scale so that I could remember which to come back to and work on again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Problem</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I needed a way to easily choose a random scale and write down a quick rating in a place I would remember for future reference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">My Analog Solution</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Normally, I would whip out my stack of flashcards that have the scale name written on them and picked one at random. Then I likely would have written a grade on a piece of paper or notebook or something.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Solution</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I created a shortcut that chose a random scale, then prompted me to rate the performance of the scale out of 5 (5 being best, 1 being the worst). This rating gets logged in a Note in my Apple Notes app.</p>

<p>This shortcut uses the "append to note" action, which is one of my favorites. You can dump whatever text you want into the input, and it will automatically add that text to the end of whatever note you have selected!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is great for keeping logs, journals, or ideas. Highly recommend playing around with it!</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Using Shortcuts has really opened my eyes to how powerful I can be with my iPhone. I no longer need to wait for some tech-bro to write an app for me to have to subscribe to in order to accomplish one task; I have the power to create an app that I can interact with exactly how I want to.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And you can too!</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everything I've talked about throughout this blog post is completely free on iPhone. The free tier of ChatGPT is completely capable of helping you if you get stuck.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I encourage you to take back agency of your phone and make it work for you. My phone <em>is</em> my world: it is one of my most expensive and by far most used devices in my life. Shortcuts enables me to use my phone in a way that benefits me, not some random tech company.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What uses for Shortcuts could you see for yourself and your most used device?</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After spending a lot time learning about design, AI tools, and code editors, I was finally ready to start putting that work to a real project instead of "practice" projects. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the course of this past year learning more about design, AI, and other tech, I found a lot of small project wins that made me more efficient in daily life, and really helped me gain some confidence. I was discovering that I've had all of this tech at my fingertips for so long, I just didn't know how to use it, and the way that I had heard people (mainly tech bros) talk about tech and programming had made me feel like I <em>couldn't </em>use these tools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Realizing that I, a "normal" person; former teacher with no computer science background could create applications made me feel so powerful and excited, that I wanted to find a way to share this with as many people as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dylan and I found so many small automations and tools that we could use, we wanted to create a platform to make them more accessible to all types of people. Thus created the idea for our nonprofit, Automate the Suck Out of Life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now that we had this mission and vision for what our nonprofit could look like, we needed to get to work on creating a website. I decided to take on this </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Birth of ATSOL</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have spent my whole twenties trying to figure out this whole "adulting" thing, and if I have heard one common sentiment of my fellow zillenials, it is this: It sucks. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, there are amazing things that come with being an adult, but you never realize how much more of your life is taken up by "adulting" tasks until you're out of the house and doing it on your own. (Did you know you need to clean your cleaning machines?? wtf??)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My husband, Dylan, and I have been navigating life together since our early twenties and have taken on these new "adulting" tasks together. We always found ourselves thinking "How do people do this?" Or rather, "How do people do this and still have time for all of the things they actually <em>want</em> to do?"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We discovered that truly wealthy people often hire out for the tasks they don't want to put their time for. For some, their time is the more finite resource than money, so they can put their money resources towards hiring people to do the tasks that take up too much of their time (cleaning, financial planning, laundry, cooking, etc.).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dylan and I wanted to experience the luxuries of not having to do "adulting" tasks and made it our personal mission to automate, or at least streamline as much of these tedious tasks as possible. As we started making these improvements in our own lives, we wanted to be able to share our findings and help folks find their own ways of getting their time back so they could spend their time doing things they enjoy more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This brought us to founding our nonprofit, Automate the Suck Out of Life. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are so excited to share more of our story and create more resources as we continue our work. I wanted to kick off our new site with a little behind the scenes of the design and development process of our website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Behind the Design</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What's in a name?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I feel the design process truly started when Dylan and I came up with the name. We are both huge fans of Hank and John Green (DFTBA nerdfighteria!) and have been incredibly inspired by their work. They are just two guys who have been able to make an incredible difference in the world through their work founding so many amazing organizations, including The Foundation to Decrease World Suck. Their mission is to decrease the suck in the world through their charity work. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While chatting about our dreams and goals for ATSOL, Dylan said, "I kinda want to call it Automate the Suck Out of Life." I really liked this because it's straight to the point, and a lil edgy (kinda sounds like automate the f*** out of life hehe).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Logo and Wordmark</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I started the visual design by noodling around in Canva. I started by putting the words "Automate the Suck Out of Life" and arranging them on the page. After a while of adjusting spacing and sizing, I wound up with something that looks like this: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":237,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://kaitlinmisaac.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/cleanshot-2025-02-28-at-11.34.25402x.png?w=658" alt="" class="wp-image-237" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I knew I wanted to have some sort of icon that we could eventually turn into a smaller stand-alone logo. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was thinking about all of the technologies and processes Dylan have brought into our routines as we've been working on automating the suck out of our own lives, and I remembered our robot vacuum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first apartment Dylan and I lived in by ourselves was completely carpeted aside from the kitchen and the bathroom. I found myself needing to vacuum constantly to keep the dust and dog hair at bay. It was time for us to buy a new vacuum anyways, and we ended up with our Roomba which we lovingly named Succ.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I found that automating one simple task had freed up much more of my time and brain than I anticipated. Aside from my actual time spent vacuuming becoming eliminated, this change also eliminated a large mental load I didn't even realize I had. Thoughts like "I should vacuum." Or "When was the last time I vacuumed?" had vanished. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our robot vacuum Succ was the first time I had felt the magic of automation. I felt the luxuriousness that all people with regular house cleaners must feel. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because of this magic, I thought a robot vacuum would be a great symbol for mine and Dylan's larger goal with ATSOL. So I started by designing a simple robot vacuum icon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":239,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://kaitlinmisaac.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/cleanshot-2025-02-28-at-11.47.22402x.png?w=1022" alt="" class="wp-image-239" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was really drawn to this green color palette and decided to start there for colors. I wanted the brand to feel modern and clean, yet welcoming and relatable. I wanted there to be a very DIY spirit, as we are trying to empower people to use the technology that they have access to. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to bring a little interest to the design, I decided to add a gradient. The robot icon felt a little sparse all by itself as well, so I decided to create a word mark within the robot vacuum icon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":242,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://kaitlinmisaac.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/cleanshot-2025-02-28-at-11.49.14402x.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-242" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I really liked the overall look, but had a few issues with it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Putting the words inside of the robot vacuum icon did not solve my problem of wanting a smaller, more simple logo for situation where the full word mark did not suffice</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>I wasn't too sure about the font</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I started brainstorming some other ideas for icons that could be used with the robot vacuum icon. I considered a spiral to indicate a vortex (sucking things up), a magic wand, and a lightening bolt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":245,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://kaitlinmisaac.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/cleanshot-2025-02-28-at-12.16.43402x.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-245" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The lightening bolt seemed like such a great symbol for automation through technology. This symbol has also had some personal significance to Dylan and I, as we're reading Harry Potter and the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViuUy2pEI4">Monster by Yung Lean</a> has been our anthem this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now that we had our logo and another symbol to integrate, I went to work on our word mark. I started by playing around with a few places to put our symbols by drawing out some options in Freeform on my iPad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":247,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://kaitlinmisaac.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/img_0136.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-247" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Definitely not an artist, but this was great for getting some ideas out quickly!</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I decided to keep iterating in Canva:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:jetpack/slideshow {"ids":[248,250,249,251],"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter" data-effect="slide"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-248" data-id="248" src="https://kaitlinmisaac.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/it1.png?w=500" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-250" data-id="250" src="https://kaitlinmisaac.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/it2.png?w=500" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-249" data-id="249" src="https://kaitlinmisaac.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/it3.png?w=500" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-251" data-id="251" src="https://kaitlinmisaac.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/it4.png?w=500" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white" role="button"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white" role="button"></a><a aria-label="Pause Slideshow" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause" role="button"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>
<!-- /wp:jetpack/slideshow -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Which finally brought me to our final word mark design:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":253,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://kaitlinmisaac.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/final-wordmark.png?w=500" alt="" class="wp-image-253" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Colors</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I really liked the green color that I had started with and started building our color palette from here. I started with a light green, the darker teal, an off white and a black color. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After playing around with different hues, I ended up with shades of green and pink as my primary color story. Our full palette ended up looking like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":257,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://kaitlinmisaac.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/colors.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-257" /></figure>
